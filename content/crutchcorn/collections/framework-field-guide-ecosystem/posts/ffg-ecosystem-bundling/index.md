<details>
    <summary>What tools are we learning in this chapter?</summary>
There are many good options out there for bundling today:

- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- [Rspack](https://www.rspack.dev/)
- [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack)

While each come with their own pros and cons, we're instead going to be focusing on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Here's why:

- Vite is the suggested bundler for Vue apps and is maintained by many of the Vue maintainers
- Vite is used by Angular's tooling to host a development server (more on that soon)
- Vite is widely adopted by modern React applications
- The configurability of the other tools _can_ be more complex in many instances
- Due to Vite's popularity, there's a lot of learning resources out there and plugins available to you immediately
- There is an ongoing effort to migrate Vite's core ([Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)) to Rust (under the name [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs/)), meaning that your Vite apps will get much faster to bundle in the future

Without further ado, let's get to the meat of the chapter.

# What does a bundler do?

It can do many things:

1) Compile templates from `.jsx`, `.vue` files and Angular Templates into dedicated CSS files and JavaScript instructions to run in the browser
2) Compile TypeScript to regular JavaScript so it can run in the browser
3) Translate newer JavaScript code into older JavaScript code so it can run in older browsers
   - This step is called "transpilation"
   - A common tool for transpilation is Babel
4) Automatically remove unused code from the output to make things faster and smaller
   - This step is called "Tree-shaking"
5) Merge multiple files that rely on one another into a single file so that HTTP doesn't have to make multiple round-trips to download everything
6) Optimize the code for size, making harder for humans to read but faster to download
   - This step is called "minification"

// TODO: WRITE

While each of these steps may call a different tool under-the-hood, most bundlers nowadays do a good job at abstracting away those nuances for many use-cases.

As such, you typically either do not need to modify a bundler's behavior beyond a couple of configuration options, if even.

> This isn't to say that you can never modify a bundler's behavior, just be aware that when you do so, there tends to be seldom resources out there to explain what to do to fix things when they go awry. Thar be dragons. üêâ





# The Bundling Pipeline





<!-- tabs:start -->

## React

```tsx
// A TypeScript React component - `App.tsx`
export const App = () => {
    const message: string = "Test";
	return <p>{message}</p>
}
```

## Angular

// TODO: Write this

## Vue

> Notice how the bundling process doesn't inherently have to include every feature available. You could, for example, opt out of the TypeScript compilation by using JavaScript.
>
> Similarly, you can often explicitly disable specific features ‚Äî like minification ‚Äî by configuring your bundler to skip that step.
